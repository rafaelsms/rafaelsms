### Hello 👋

I am Rafael, a brazilian 🇧🇷 CS student, Motorola Mobility Group intern ☎️ and a Minecraft server 🎲 owner at my free time.

My projects here are mostly related to Minecraft server-side modifications to attend my server needs and some private personal related repositories. Nothing intresting really. I think I can say that I know Python, C and Java.

I enjoy cooking, watching series and I love my two cats. 🐈‍⬛ 🐱

You can reach me [via my website](https://rafaelsms.com).
