### Hello 👋

I am Rafael, a brazilian 🇧🇷 computer science student.

My projects here are mostly related to Minecraft modifications to attend my server needs and some private personal related repositories. Nothing intresting really.

I think it is safe to say that I know Python, C, Java and JavaScript. I enjoy cooking, watching series and I love my two cats. 🐱🐈
