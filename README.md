### Hello 👋

I am Rafael. My projects here are mostly related to Minecraft server modifications and some private repositories with various scripts and data analisys.

I think it is safe to say that I know Python, C, Java and JavaScript. I enjoy photography, cooking, watching series and I love my three cats. 🐱🐈
